# Overview of Angular

[Angular](angular.io) is a full-featured framework that makes it easy to develop web applications. Angular is built by Google and used by them for many of their own web applications.

Angular is written in TypeScript, and any Angular applications you write will also be written in TypeScript. Angular also provide a command-line tool, the Angular CLI, which consists of a set of commands that help with both the initial setup and the day-to-day development of an Angular application, with auto-generated code and boilerplate.

The Angular library itself contains a built-in HTML templating engine, decorators that hook your TypeScript code directly into a template, and modules that handle web forms, HTTP, routing, browser animations and many other aspects of web development.

The Angular documentation can be found at https://angular.io/docs, which will be a useful reference while you work on any Angular applications. For now, though, we will learn by doing, and jump straight into developing our first Angular app.
